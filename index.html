                    Welcome to our official guide. Many users wonder how they can consistently reach their 
                    <strong>daily limit of 50 ads</strong> without feeling overwhelmed. 
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Consistency is the key to financial growth within the Mini App ecosystem."
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    First, try to spread your ad-watching throughout the day. Instead of watching all 50 at once, 
                    try doing 10 in the morning, 10 during lunch, and the rest in the evening. This ensures 
                    you don't miss out on high-value rewards.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Remember to always keep your Telegram app updated to the latest version to ensure 
                    the Ad-SDK functions smoothly without any glitches.
